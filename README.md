# SQL_Factbook

In this project I use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. 
The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

**- population:** the global population.  
**- population_growth:** the annual population growth rate, as a percentage.  
**- area:** the total land and water area.
